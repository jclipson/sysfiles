# sysfiles
The dotfiles I use for managing nixos system config on my personal machine.
=======
I'll keep this simple, because this is a private project, but I might share it in the future.

This is just a collection of dotfiles I use to manage my NixOS config. It doesn't (yet) include anything from .config, so all my other config is absent for now (sorry).
If you have never used NixOS before and are considering using this as your own config... uhh... don't. Frankly, it sucks. Find a better one, I urge you.
