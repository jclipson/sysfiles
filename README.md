# <u>sysfiles<u>
The dotfiles I use for managing nixos system config on my personal machine.

This is all the system config that I use on the NixOS system that I daily drive.
This is not intended, really, to be used by anyone other than me, but feel free to fork or use as a template. Athough, I feel obligated to stress that there are much better dotfiles available.

Does not yet include my other dotfiles for the programs that I use, but I will add them soon.
