# <u>sysfiles<u>
The dotfiles I use for managing nixos system config on my personal machine.

This is all the system config that I use on the NixOS system that I daily drive.
This is not intended, really, to be used by anyone other than me, but feel free to use it as a template (although there are much better ones available)
